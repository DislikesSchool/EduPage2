## Faster EduPage
A custom EduPage mobile client written in dart using the flutter framework.
The application uses a special caching server developed by @vyPal. This caching server periodically pulls data from EduPage servers, strips them of any unnecessary data, and stores them in RAM for quick access, when the app tries to load it. 

**!IMPORTANT!** This app was not made by EduPage, it is only a custom client. Most features are not yet implemented. A list of implemented features and other features, that will be arriving soon are included in the list below.
